<li> Do not wash your hair everyday because shampoo traps your natural oils, which dries your hair out, unless you have really oily hair; wash it more frequently. </li>
<li>  After you shampoo your hair, leave your conditioner in for a couple minutes so it can moisturize and soften your hair. </li>
<li> The less heat you give to your hair the better. </li>
<li> Using cold water strengthens and shines the hair. </li>
<li> Use a t-shirt to wrap your hair instead of a towel. </li>
<li> Do not brush your hair when it is wet, it can cause breakage to it. </li>
<li> About every 7 weeks, trim your hair one fourth of an inch to avoid the split ends. </li>
<li> Using coconut, almond, castor, and olive oil for your hair is amazing. </li>
<li> Smoking and eating unhealthy is bad for your hair. </li>
<li> Clean out your brushes!!! Do not use the same ones forever.
